        <p>I'm a word association robot.
            I generate word-webs containing words associated with your provided keyword.
            I get smarter everytime you use (or abuse) me.
            You can also help me get smarter by providing feedback on each of the words.
        </p>

        <h2>Providing feedback</h2>

        <p>
            You can help me get smarter by hovering over a word and clicking one of the icons:
        </p>

        <ul class="voting-info">
            <li>
                <div class="red info-downvote">-</div>
                Use this button to downvote this association,
                because you think it doesn't have anything to do with the keyword.
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="green info-upvote">+</div>
                Upvote! If you think that this is a strong association,
                upvote the hell out of it.
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="blue">X</div>
                Report this word for the blacklist.
                Either you think it's not a word or it's not going to be an association for anything.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>If the word changes to the color of the clicked icon, it means I received your command!</p>

        <h2>Word Surfing</h2>

        <p>
            You can surf through all the associations by clicking on one of the generated words. Suuuuuurfin' bird (or
            word, whatever floats your goat).
        </p>

        <h2>Breadcrumbs</h2>

        <p>By word surfing you leave behind breadcrumbs of each word.
            Clicking on a breadcrumb brings you back to the word-web that was generated for that word, with the exact
            same associations.</p>
