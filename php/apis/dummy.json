      "text": "CJI praises Jethmalani's resolve April 12 2015 New Delhi, April 12 : Chief Justice of India H.L.Dattu on Saturday complimented eminent jurist Ram Jethmalani for having passed through so many odds in his life to achieve what he was today. Speaking after releasing his biography,\"The Rebel\" by Susan Adelman, he said that he would have said a lot about the chequered career of Jethmalani and his achievements but he had to \"restrain\" himself as everything said by him gets attributed to the him as chief justice of India. Describing the biography \"a wonderful book\" about a \"great lawyer\" , Chief Justice Dattu - who had once assisted AAAJethmalani in a case in a Bengaluru court - said: \"This man has passed through so many odds in life to achieve what he is today.\" Jethmalani said he has lived an \"extraordinary life in an extraordinarily way\". Taking pride in the Sufi culture of Sindh where he was born and educated, Jethmalani equated Kashmiriat to it, and said it would be his effort in his life to see that Kashmiriat was restored to Kashmir. He regretted that like politics, the legal profession too has fallen in the esteem of the people and hoped that the younger generation of lawyers would one day restore to the legal profession to its pristine glory. Disclosing the secret of his undiminishing energy, he quipped that as one grows older, they should keep the company of youngsters. Adelman said that she studied 400 judgments of the cases argued by Jethmalani before writing the book. Source: IANS",

      "text": "Originally Posted By: treblig1958 There is always silly rumors like that surrounding a man who goes through life as a bachelor. What we do know is if you were a homosexual in Nazi Germany you were deep in that closet because if the Gastapo ever found you.\nThis is exactly what you get when you have a Democrat in the White House, all the creeps and all the weirdos and all the sexual deviants start coming out from under their slimy rocks. But I'm normal I was born this way they'll squeal and the mainstream media will embrace any and all just to further their atheist agenda.\nTrue, if you were a homosexual in Nazi Germany you'd likely wind up in Sachesenhausen wearing a Pink Triangle. This did not apply to members of the hierarchy of the Nazi Party. The were exempt, like any member of a statist totalitarian ruling class. There's plenty of evidence that Hitler was a homosexual, or at least bisexual. Especially during his younger years, but people who would possibly know were liquidated early in his political career. Hermann Goering (Goring) certainly was.\nHomosexuality is the antithesis of what totalitarian states demand, that the population stays in the control of the State, meekly producing children to be turned over to the State for indoctrination into whatever values the State desires, with no toleration for any type of behavior deemed deviant by the State. That's what \"Gay Liberation\" followers and theologians do not understand, that they are temporarily tolerated and used by totalitarians for purposes of societal disruption and decay, yet once totalitarianism is achieved they will inevitably be relegated to the modern equivalent of Sachesenhausen once they are no longer of use.\nEdited by Ken61 ( Today at 07:17 AM )",

They bore me to tears and I still don't see any chemistry whatsoever.\nCurious to see what's coming up with this: You have Hope wanting to investigate Clyde, nosing around about Victor, and giving warnings to Chad. You have Abby involved with both Ben and Chad. You have Clyde helping Ben out with Chad being an asshole. And Hope went to Rafe with her thoughts.

(Alex's old, old, old car )\nRoadsters are pretty thin on the ground, so finding one privately on the used market is going to be tough. (Not surprising as there are only 20 in the whole country according to www.howmanyleft.co.uk !! ) The LF1 is positively common in comparison\nIf I sold the Elise privately I might get a few quid more, but it would need tidying a little (sorry Alex, I've not looked after it as well as I could, it's developed paint blisters on the PAX door, plus an apex cone scuff from Blyton, and god knows how many stone chips from the Stelvio pass ). Saying that I've put 8k miles on it in under 2 years, so it doesn't owe me anything.\nSimon if that's the car It's stunning!\nVery jealous.\nHave to say i will be sad to see my old Car move on.\nYou can buy it back from me if you want I Still have the original wheels and tyres in the shed",

      "text": "Hi everybody I just got some max life shoes for my 8t 2.0 and I noticed when fitting them they look very small now I've just measured them the same way that drakes says and he says smaller than 23.4mm is no good but these just came out of a packet and they're at 23.4mm without being run so I just wanted to get some opinions on whether this is ok or not.\nCheers\nRoss",
